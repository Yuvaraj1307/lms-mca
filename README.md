# Library Management System (LMS)

Welcome to the Library Management System (LMS) project repository!

## Project Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to facilitate the management of books, borrowers, and other library resources efficiently. This system helps librarians and administrators to manage library operations such as book borrowing, returns, and inventory management.

## Frontend Setup

To run the frontend of the LMS project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

3. After the installation is complete, start the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

This will launch the frontend application, and you can access it in your web browser at the specified address.

## Backend Setup

To run the backend of the LMS project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

3. After the installation is complete, start the backend server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

The backend server will start running, providing the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with.

## Database Setup

The LMS project utilizes a database to store information about books, borrowers, and other relevant data. Ensure that you have set up a compatible database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and configured the connection details in the backend environment variables.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to configure the backend server with appropriate database connection details before running it.
- Ensure that you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system before proceeding with the setup.
- For production deployment, refer to the respective documentation for frontend and backend deployment strategies.

Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute to the project. Happy managing your library resources!
